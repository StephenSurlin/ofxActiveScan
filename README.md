About
--------

This repository is an openFrameworks addon for active 3D scanning using
uncalibrated projector-camera system. While this takes addon-style,
you can start 3D scanning just by compiling the included example projects.

3D scanning algorithm is heavily relying on the software provided by
[Mr. Shuntaro Yamazaki][1] and visualization is inspired by [ProCamToolkit][2].
